# 0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects
A class creates a new type. Objects on the other hand are instances of the class.
Variables that belong to a class/object are known as <b>fields.</b>
A <b>method</b> is a function that belongs to a class.
Fields and methods are referred to as <b>attributes</b> of the class.
Fields can either be instance or class variables.
