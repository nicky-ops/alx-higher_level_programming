## What's a database
is a structured collection of data organized and stored in a way that allows efficient access, retrieval, and management.

## What's a relational database
A relational database is a type of database that organizes and stores data following the relational model. It structures data into tables, which consist of rows and columns. The relationships between these tables are defined by shared data between them.

Key characteristics of a relational database include:

*Tables:* Data is stored in tables where each row represents a record or instance, and each column represents a specific attribute or field.
*Relationships:* Tables can be related to each other through common fields (primary keys and foreign keys). For instance, in a database for a store, the "Customers" table might be related to the "Orders" table by a common customer ID field.
*ACID Properties:* Relational databases adhere to ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties to ensure data integrity, accuracy, and reliability even in the event of system failures or errors.
*Structured Query Language (SQL):* Relational databases use SQL as the standard language for querying and managing the data. SQL enables users to retrieve, manipulate, and manage data efficiently.
Popular examples of relational database management systems (RDBMS) include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite.
