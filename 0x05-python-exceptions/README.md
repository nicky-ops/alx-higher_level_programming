# 0x05. Python - Exceptions
## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
* Why Python programming is awesome
* What’s the difference between errors and exceptions
* What are exceptions and how to use them
* When do we need to use exceptions
* How to correctly handle an exception
* What’s the purpose of catching exceptions
* How to raise a builtin exception
* When do we need to implement a clean-up action after an exception

There are two distinguishable types of errors: syntax and exceptions.
## 1. Syntax Errors
These are errors in the syntax of a sequence of characters or tokens that is intended to be written in a particular programming language.

## 2. Exceptions
Are errors detected during execution and are not unconditionally fata. Exceptions come in different types, and the type is printed as part of the message. Examples of exceptions are; NameError, ZeroDivisionError and TypeError.
